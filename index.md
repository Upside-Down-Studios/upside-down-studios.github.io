# Upside Down Studios

## Turning traditional games on their head.

Tired of having to pay $300 for a game console? $60 for a new game? So are we. Upside Down Studios seeks to solve this terrible dilemma with an ingenious system.

### How does it work?
Upside Down Studios works by having a computer application that runs games. No need to buy a silly Nintendo Switch or $500 XBox. Make a game console from your own computer without paying $60 for every game.
### Price
Upside Down Studios can be purchased at the low price of free.
### Controllers and Input
Attach any major game system controller, such as PS4/5, Nintendo Switch, or Xbox, and then play the game. Conversely, you can just use the traditional mouse and arrow keys/WASD.
### Operating Systems Supported
Windows is only currently supported, but Mac builds will come soon as well. Linux may also be supported in the future.
### Contribute
