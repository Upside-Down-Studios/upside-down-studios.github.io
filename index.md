# Upside Down Studios

## Turning traditional games on their head.

Tired of having to pay $300 for a game console? $60 for a new game? So are we. Upside Down Studios seeks to solve this terrible dilemma with an ingenious system.

### How does it work?
Upside Down Studios works by having a computer application that runs games. No need to buy a silly Nintendo Switch or $500 XBox! Just download, run, and play.
### How much does it cost?
Upside Down Studios can be purchased at the low price of free.
### Can I use controllers?
Yes! Just attach any major game system controller, such as PS4/5, Nintendo Switch, or Xbox, and then play the game. Conversely, you can just use the traditional mouse and arrow keys/WASD.
### What operating systems are supported?
Windows is only currently supported, but Mac builds will come soon as well.
### How can I contribute?
Make a Unity game and send it to us via github.

Convinced? Go ahead and look at our game catalogue, all of which are 100% free, and then download the app today!
