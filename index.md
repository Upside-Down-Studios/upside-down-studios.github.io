# Upside Down Studios

## Turning traditional games on their head.

### How does it work?
Upside Down Studios works by having a computer application that runs games. No need to buy a silly Nintendo Switch or $500 XBox! Just download, run, and play.
### How much does it cost?
Upside Down Studios can be purchased at the low price of free.
### What is the catch
No, there isn't a catch. Just download, install our selection of games, and play. These are just the games that we make as a side hobby, bundled into a neat package.
### What operating systems?
Windows is only currently supported, but Mac builds will come soon as well.
### How can I contribute?
Make a Unity game and send it to us via github.
